# Code of Conduct

## Diversity Statement

> We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has a fun, enjoyable, and pleasant experience. Everyone who participates in ArabR is expected to abide by this code of conduct and show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times. 


We–as members, contributors, and organisers–pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of their age, body size, visible or invisible disability, pregnancy, citizenship, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender,  gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, experience level, language, dialect, personal appearance, race, familial status, veteran status, religion, and sexual orientation.


**Complete [this Incident Report Form]() to alert the Code of Conduct Response Team if you notice someone in distress, or observe violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.**

## Expected Behaviour 

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, supportive, and healthy community. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all meetings or participation in ArabR activities. 
Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people.

- **Use welcoming and inclusive language.**
- **Be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.**
- **Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.**
- **Accept responsibility** and apologise to those affected by our mistakes, and learn from the experience.
- **Act when you witness unacceptable behaviour.** If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up to the Code of Conduct Team. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.
- **As an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes.**
- **Try to understand why there are disagreements.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity contributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people from a wide range of backgrounds.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Behaviour that is unacceptable includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to their age, body size, visible or invisible disability, pregnancy, citizenship, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, experience level, language, dialect, personal appearance, race, familial status, veteran status and religion.
- Stalking, e.g. persistent unwanted direct messages, sending unwanted pictures or malware links, logging online activity for harassment purposes.

- Sharing private conversations and discussions (e.g., screenshots of discussion channels or zoom, direct messages, email addresses, etc), without their explicit permission (except when reporting to the Code of Conduct Response Team)

> If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour, you should stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke.
