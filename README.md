>### How to add a post

>Adding a post can be done as easily as creating a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file with the naming convention as `file_name.language_code.md`.
*language_code* is a two character code in compliance with [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). Currently the website supports 20 languages including *Arabic, English, French*. 
post must have a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) front matter. [Parameters are usually theme specific](https://github.com/Vimux/Mainroad#front-matter-example) but the bare minimum can be as shown in the example below. 

#### Most basic example 

```
#file name : Getting_Started.en.md
---
title: "Getting Started"
date : "2022-01-25"
draft : false 
---     

You write your content here in markdown formats
```
